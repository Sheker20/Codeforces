## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Codeforces/
├── Contest-Name-Or-Number/
│ ├── Problem-A.cpp
│ ├── Problem-B.java
│ └── Problem-C.py
├── Algorithms/
│ ├── Dynamic-Programming/
│ ├── Graph-Theory/

If you want, I can also make an **even cooler version with badges** showing your programming languages, number of problems solved, and Codeforces rating — which makes the repo look super professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to make that version too?
